# ProsperAIO

This is the source code for the 4th major version was my first big side project. It played a key role in developing both my initial knowledge and passion for web development. It taught me a lot about how the web works and involved making requests to various servers. Working on this project also gave me a thorough understanding of JavaScript, my core programming language.

In this very latest version of the project I implemented several Go modules to enhance performance.
